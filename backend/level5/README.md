# Level 5

Some drivers want to be able to buy additionnal features after their booking.

Here are the possible options:
- GPS: 5€/day, all the money goes to the owner
- Baby Seat: 2€/day, all the money goes to the owner
- Additional Insurance: 10€/day, all the money goes to Getaround
(Note : Same to the level 3, I think the correct rate is 500€/day for GPS, 200€/day for baby seat and 1000€/day for insurance)

_This is the final level, now would be a good time to tidy up your code and do a last round of refactoring :)_
